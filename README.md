# JavaScript Simon Game

This Simon game was built with Javascript and jQuery. It fullfilled the following user stories:

1. When the game starts, player will be presented with a random series of button presses.

2. Each time players input a series of button presses correctly, 
they will see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.

3. Players hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, 
and when they personally press a button.

4. If players press the wrong button, they will be notified, and that series of button presses starts again.

5. Players can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.

6. If Players want to restart, they can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.

7. Players can play in strict mode where if they get a button press wrong, 
   it notifies them, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.

8. Players can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. 
They will be notified of their victory, then the game starts over.
